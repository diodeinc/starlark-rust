//! A `record` type, comprising of a fixed set of fields.
//!
//! Calling `record()` produces a `RecordType`. Calling `RecordType` produces a [`Record`].
//! The field names of the record are only stored once, potentially reducing memory usage.
//! Created in Starlark using the `record()` function, which accepts keyword arguments.
//! The keys become field names, and values are the types. Calling the resulting
//! function produces an actual record.
//!
//! ```
//! # starlark::assert::is_true(r#"
//! IpAddress = record(host=str, port=int)
//! rec = IpAddress(host="localhost", port=80)
//! rec.port == 80
//! # "#);
//! ```
//!
//! It is also possible to use `field(type, default)` type to give defaults:
//!
//! ```
//! # starlark::assert::is_true(r#"
//! IpAddress = record(host=str, port=field(int, 80))
//! rec = IpAddress(host="localhost")
//! rec.port == 80
//! # "#);
//! ```
